# Google Summer of Code 2017 with SageMath

During the summer of 2017, I contributed to [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org) as a part of the Google Summer of Code program. Sage is an open-source Python-based mathematics software that is built on top of existing open-source packages (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R and many more). My work was primarily related to improving the complex dynamics functionality in Sage and more specifically, the plotting Mandelbrot and Julia Sets. I completed this project under the mentorship of Dr. Benjamin Hutz and Dr. Adam Towsley. 

For more details on this project please visit [my blog](https://benbarros.wordpress.com) that was stood up for this project or by visiting the [Google Summer of Code page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/5608589620150272/) for this project.

Here are a few cool images that I was able to plot using the Complex Dynamics functionality in Sage:
